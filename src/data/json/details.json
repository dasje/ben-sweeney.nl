          "This was a continuation of the training role begun with my experience at Young Coders. It was a challenging role that encompassed a wide range of disciplines, and provided me with opportunities to expand both my technological knowledge and my training abilities.",
          "In this role I took lead roles in the creation of two applications oriented on data ingestion and analysis. I was also part of a team spearheading the first integration of ChatGPT into a live product that parses public company accounts and confirms compliance with ESG rulings.",
          "In my lead roles I was responsible for requirements gathering, data modeling, ETL pipelines, MVP front ends, and integration into existing platforms. In both cases my role included training junior developers; this took the shape of one-to-one sessions, walking through tasks, knowledge sharing sessions, providing meaningful pull request feedback, and maintaining standards in the code base.",

          "Beginning with a six week bootcamp, in which we built a dashboard in which investors could view the current/historical values of their stocks and shares, the training moved immediately from the classroom to a placement in a developer team at PwC.",
          "Here I built dashboards for auditors to analyse accounts for outliers and risks. Proof of concepts were designed in PowerBI and then built for internal platforms with front ends built in React, and data handling with Python.",
